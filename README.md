## Overview

**WorksBot** is a full-stack AI interview preparation web application. Candidates upload their resume, and the system:

1. Extracts and parses resume data (skills, projects, experience, education)
2. Generates personalized **technical interview questions** based solely on resume content
3. Dynamically **adapts difficulty** (Easy to Medium to Hard) based on answer quality
4. Conducts **coding interviews** with live code execution against hidden test cases
5. Produces comprehensive **AI-generated performance reports** with scores, feedback, and improvement suggestions

The platform uses **Groq's LLaMA 3 70B** model for all AI reasoning, **LangChain** for orchestration, **ChromaDB** for RAG retrieval, and **Judge0** as a sandboxed code execution engine.

## Code Execution Sandbox

The platform uses **Judge0 v1.13.0** (self-hosted via Docker) to safely execute user code:

- Supports: Python 3, JavaScript (Node.js), Java, C, C++
- Runs visible sample test cases on Run Code
- Runs hidden test cases (not visible to user) on Submit
- Falls back to local Python subprocess sandbox when Judge0 is unavailable

---

## RAG Knowledge Base

Two ChromaDB vector stores augment AI reasoning:

| Store | Purpose |
|---|---|
| rag_technical/ | Interview best practices, evaluation rubrics, question patterns |
| rag_coding/ | Algorithm patterns, data structure knowledge, problem-solving strategies |

Documents are embedded and stored locally in chroma_db/ subdirectories. Run create_vector_db.py in each folder to initialize.

---

Built using FastAPI, Next.js, LangChain, Groq, Judge0, and ChromaDB.
